<app-zippy title="How does the transaction works?"> 
    <p>
      The customer selects the Artisan and date of inspection. The artisan goes for the inspection and then accesses the issue. If materials need to be bought, the artisan quote for the job through the app. The quote goes to the Service Manager at Essential Artisan and the customer. Once the customer agrees with the quote, the sum is paid to Essential Artisan’s account. If no material is needed to fix the issue, the artisan gets the issue fixed and the customer is charged a fee which will also be paid to Essential Artisan’s account.      </p>
